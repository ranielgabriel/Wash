    <string name="about">
            \tWash is a mobile Android application that will aid potential user(s) to be able to easily locate restroom locations nearby or within a particular area.
        Essentially, with the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable Google Maps with high accuracy locating method.
        Moreover, Internet connection, such as Wi-Fi and mobile data, are also significant to retrieve real-time and reliable information about the restroom locations.
        As the application also guides the user(s) towards a particular restroom location by depicting the shortest possible route, making it most convenient to reach their desired restroom location.
        Specific details regarding the restroom locations, such as floor level and business establishment name (e.g. malls, fast food dining, gasoline stations, etc.) are also provided by Wash to eliminate ambiguity for the user(s).
        \n
        \n
            \tWash also conveys sophisticated features such as displaying a photo gallery, ratings, and reviews of the former user(s) of the restroom.
        Whereas, the photo gallery will aid them to see the restroom’s physical appearance.
        Also, the rating and review of the former individual user shows their perspective and point of view about a restroom location.
        These two features will assist the potential user(s) with their decision-making dilemma on whether to go to that particular restroom location or choose another one.
        Additionally, the application also shows availability status of the restroom. If in case the restroom is unavailable, user(s) cannot utilize the route guide feature mentioned above.
        \n
        \n
            \tFurthermore, Wash also uses the rating and reviews as a feedback from the user(s) and customer(s) of the restrooms located within a business establishment. 
        Where owners of the business can view these feedback and encourage them to improve their restroom quality.
        Likewise, the application will also promote the cleanliness, orderliness, and improve the quality of the restrooms of the business establishments.
